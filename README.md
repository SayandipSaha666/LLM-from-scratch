# Building GPT-2 from Scratch

This project implements a GPT-2–style transformer language model entirely from the ground up using PyTorch. It is built step by step — from data preprocessing and tokenization to constructing the multi-head attention mechanism, transformer blocks, and training loop — without relying on high-level libraries.

## Key Features
- **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)** tokenization  
- **Positional embeddings** and **multi-head self-attention**  
- **Transformer decoder blocks** stacked to form the model  
- **Training pipeline** for text datasets  
- **Text generation** with autoregressive decoding

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to gain a deep understanding of how large language models like GPT-2 work internally. It serves as an educational resource for exploring the foundations of modern transformer-based language models.
